# public_projects
This is a portfolio of my public projects using Python. This are personal analytic investigations, intended for viewing by any interested parties. Currently, this includes:

## nba_project

This is a brief investigation of the concept of "consistency" in NBA. It attempts to formalize a statistical definition of "consistency" using the concepts of entropy and standard deviation. It includes:

1. An expository Python notebook explaining the motivation for the project, the justification of the methodology, and a visualization of the output
2. The "scrape" module, which collects the relevant game logs for every player in NBA history
3. The "calculate" module, which includes the core functions for calculating consistency for each player.
